# Long-term, Phantom Quality Assurance data for functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging from 13 3T research scanners

## Overview

Function Biomedical Informatics Research Network (fBIRN) phantoms were scanned at monthly intervals for four years as a quality assurance (QA) measure to monitor between- and within-site stability in 13 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners participating in the multisite, longitudinal studies of the Ontario Brain Institute’s (OBI) Ontario Neurodegeneration Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI) and Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) programs.
Acquisitions were performed using the resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) sequence of the Canadian Dementia Imaging Protocol (CDIP; www.cdip-pcid.ca).

This open data release includes DICOM images from 629 resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scans acquired from five General Electric, two Philips, and six Siemens 3T scanners (mean number of scans per scanner = 48.5), as well as QA summary results for each scan as derived from the fBIRN pipeline.
